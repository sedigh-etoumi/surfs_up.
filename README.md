# surfs_up.

Overview:
  W. Avy likes your analysis, but he wants more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months   of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.
  
June Analysis:
  We are going to use Python, Pandas functions and methods, and SQLAlchemy, we filter the date column of the Measurements table in the hawaii.sqlite database to           retrieve all the temperatures for the month of June. we will then convert those temperatures to a list, create a DataFrame from the list, and generate the summary       statistics. 
  After we generate DataFrame summary we got the results in the following screenshot.
